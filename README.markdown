 ## Instructions
 
 Completely disregard the master branch, it's a mess of outdated code from the old app 
 
 Instead, check out the branch `intrepid-chris` for an actual working version of the app
 
 ### Notes on this app vs Play Store app
 It's also important to note that the version of the MIT app currently on the Play Store is not the same as this app. That app is PhoneGap (_shudders_) and this one is 100% native. I'll leave it to you to decide which one you like better.
 
 ### FAQ
 Why has a 100% native, ready-to-go app just been sitting up on MIT's github for 2 years?
 
 That's an excellent question, I suggest asking MIT's IST department for an answer because I can't think of any good ones
